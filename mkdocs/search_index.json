            "text": "How do I?\n\n\nI have an account, now:\n\n\nHow do I log in?\n\n\nLogging in is most straightforward if you are inside the UCL firewall. If you are logging in from home or other external networks then you first have to \nget on to the UCL network\n.\n\n\nLinux / Unix / Mac OS X\n\n\nUse the terminal and type the below command to secure shell (ssh) into the machine you wish to access. Replace \n<your_UCL_user_id>\n with your central UCL username, and \n<system_name>\n with the name of the machine you want to log in to, eg. \nlegion\n, \ngrace\n, \naristotle\n. \n\n\nssh <your_UCL_user_id>@<system_name>.rc.ucl.ac.uk\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\nOn Windows you need something that will give you a suitable terminal and ssh - usually PuTTY, although you could also use Cygwin if you wanted a full Linux-like environment.\n\n\nUsing PuTTY\n\n\nPuTTY is a common SSH client on Windows and is available on Desktop@UCL. You can find it under \nStart > All Programs > Applications O-P > PuTTY\n\n\nYou will need to create an entry for the host you are connecting to with the settings below. If you want to save your settings, give them an easily-identifiable name in the \"Saved Sessions\" box and press \"Save\". Then you can select it and \"Load\" next time you use PuTTY. \n\n\n\n\nIn newer versions of PuTTY, it looks like this.\n\n\nTODO: new putty\n\n\nYou will then be asked to enter your username and password. Only enter your username, not \n@legion.rc.ucl.ac.uk\n. The password field will remain entirely blank when you type in to it - it does not show placeholders to indicate you have typed something. \n\n\nLogging in from outside the UCL firewall\n\n\nYou will need to either use the \nUCL Virtual Private Network\n or ssh in to UCL's gateway \nsocrates.ucl.ac.uk\n first. From Socrates you can then ssh in to our systems by typing \nssh <your_UCL_user_id>@<system_name>.rc.ucl.ac.uk\n. \n\n\nAdvanced:\n If you find you need to go via Socrates often, you can set up this jump automatically, see \nSingle-step logins using tunnelling\n\n\nLogin problems\n\n\nIf you experience difficulties with your login, please make sure that you are typing your UCL user ID and your password correctly. If you have recently updated your password, it takes some hours to propagate to all UCL systems.\n\n\nIf you still cannot get access but can access other UCL services like Socrates, please contact us on rc-support@ucl.ac.uk. Your account may have expired, or you may have gone over quota.\n\n\nIf you cannot access anything, please see UCL MyAccount - you may need to request a password reset from the Service Desk. \n\n\nIf you get a host key error message, you will need to delete old host keys. \nTODO: details\n\n\nHow do I transfer data onto the system?\n\n\nYou can transfer data to and from our systems using any program capable of using the Secure Copy (SCP) protocol. This uses the same SSH system as you use to log in to a command line session, but then transfers data over it. This means that if you can use SSH to connect to a system, you can usually use SCP to transfer files to it. \n\n\nCopying files using Linux or Mac OS X\n\n\nYou can use the command-line utilities scp, sftp or rsync to copy your data about. You can also use a graphical client (Transmit, CyberDuck, FileZilla).\n\n\nscp\n\n\nThis will copy a data file from somewhere on your local machine to a specified location on the remote machine (Legion, Grace etc).\n\n\nscp <local_data_file> <remote_user_id>@<remote_hostname>:<remote_path>\n\n\n\n\n# Example: copy myfile from your local current directory into Scratch on Legion\nscp myfile ccxxxxx@legion.rc.ucl.ac.uk:~/Scratch/\n\n\n\n\nThis will do the reverse, copying from the remote machine to your local machine. (This is still run from your local machine).\n\n\nscp <remote_user_id>@<remote_hostname>:<remote_path><remote_data_file> <local_path>\n\n\n\n\n# Example: copy myfile from Legion into the Backups directory in your local current directory\nscp ccxxxxx@legion.rc.ucl.ac.uk:~/Scratch/myfile Backups/\n\n\n\n\nsftp\n\n\nYou can use sftp to log in to the remote machine, navigate through directories and use \nput\n and \nget\n to copy files from and to your local machine. \nlcd\n and \nlls\n are local equivalents of \ncd\n and \nls\n so you can navigate through your local directories as you go. \n\n\nsftp <remote_user_id>@<remote_hostname>\ncd <remote_path>\nget <remote_file>\nlcd <local_path>\nput <local_file>\n\n\n\n\n# Example: download a copy of file1 into your local current directory,\n# change local directory and upload a copy of file2\nsftp ccxxxxx@legion.rc.ucl.ac.uk\ncd Scratch/files\nget file1\nlcd ../files_to_upload\nput file2\n\n\n\n\nrsync\n\n\nRsync is used to remotely synchronise directories, so can be used to only copy files which have changed. Have a look at \nman rsync\n as there are many options. \n\n\nCopying files using Windows and WinSCP\n\n\nWinSCP is a graphical client that you can use for scp or sftp.\n\n\n\n\nThe login/create new session screen will open if this is the first time you are using WinSCP.\n\n\nYou can choose SFTP or SCP as the file protocol. If you have an unstable connection with one, you may wish to try the other. SCP is probably generally better.\n\n\nFill in the hostname of the machine you wish to connect to, your username and password.\n\n\nClick Save and give your settings a useful name.\n\n\nYou'll then be shown your list of Stored sessions, which will have the one you just created.\n\n\nSelect the session and click Login.\n\n\n\n\nTransferring files from outside the UCL firewall\n\n\nAs when logging in, when you are outside the UCL firewall you will need a method to connect inside it before you copy files. (You do not want to be copying files on to Socrates and then on to our systems - this is slow, unnecessary, and it means you need space available on Socrates too).\n\n\nYou can use the \nUCL Virtual Private Network\n and scp direct to our systems or you can do some form of ssh tunnelling.\n\n\nSingle-step logins using tunnelling\n\n\nLinux / Unix / Mac OS X\n\n\nInside your \n~/.ssh\n directory on your local machine, add the below to your \nconfig\n file (or create a file called \nconfig\n if you don't already have one).\n\n\nGenerically, it should be of this form where \n<name>\n can be anything you want to call this entry.\n\n\nHost <name>\n   User <remote_user_id>\n   HostName <remote_hostname>\n   proxyCommand ssh -W <remote_hostname>:22 <remote_user_id>@socrates.ucl.ac.uk\n\n\n\n\nThis causes the commands you type in your client to be forwarded on over a secure channel to the specified remote host.\n\n\nHere are some examples - you can have as many of these as you need in your config file.\n\n\nHost legion\n   User ccxxxxx\n   HostName legion.rc.ucl.ac.uk\n   proxyCommand ssh -W legion.rc.ucl.ac.uk:22 ccxxxxx@socrates.ucl.ac.uk\n\nHost login05\n   User ccxxxxx\n   HostName login05.external.legion.ucl.ac.uk\n   proxyCommand ssh -W login05.external.legion.ucl.ac.uk:22 ccxxxxx@socrates.ucl.ac.uk\n\nHost aristotle\n   User ccxxxxx\n   HostName aristotle.rc.ucl.ac.uk\n   proxyCommand ssh -W aristotle.rc.ucl.ac.uk:22 ccxxxxx@socrates.ucl.ac.uk\n\n\n\n\nYou can now just type \nssh legion\n or \nscp file1 aristotle:~\n and you will go through Socrates. You'll be asked for login details twice since you're logging in to two machines, Socrates and your endpoint.  \n\n\nWindows - WinSCP\n\n\nWinSCP can also set up SSH tunnels.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new session as before, and tick the Advanced options box in the bottom left corner.\n\n\nSelect Connection > Tunnel from the left pane.\n\n\nTick the Connect through SSH tunnel box and enter the hostname of the gateway you are tunnelling through, for example socrates.ucl.ac.uk\n\n\nFill in your username and password for that host. (Central UCL ones for Socrates).\n\n\nSelect Session from the left pane and fill in the hostname you want to end up on after the tunnel.\n\n\nFill in your username and password for that host and set the file protocol to SCP.\n\n\nSave your settings with a useful name.\n\n\n\n\nWindows - PuTTY\n\n\nYou can use PuTTY for tunnelling when you just want a single-step login and not a file transfer.\n\n\nManaging your quota\n\n\nHow do I submit a job to the scheduler?\n\n\nTo submit a job to the scheduler you need to write a jobscript that contains the resources the job is asking for and the actual commands you want to run. This jobscript is then submitted using the \nqsub\n command.\n\n\nqsub myjobscript\n\n\n\n\nIt will be put in to the queue and will begin running on the compute nodes at some point later when it has been allocated resources.\n\n\nPassing in qsub options on the command line\n\n\nThe \n#$\n lines in your jobscript are options to qsub. It will take each line which has \n#$\n as the first two characters and use the contents beyond that as an option. \n\n\nYou can also pass options directly to the qsub command and this will override the settings in your script. This can be useful if you are scripting your job submissions in more complicated ways.\n\n\nFor example, if you want to change the name of the job for this one instance of the job you can submit your script with:\n\n\nqsub -N NewName myscript.sh\n\n\n\n\nOr if you want to increase the wall-clock time to 24 hours:\n\n\nqsub -l h_rt=24:0:0 myscript.sh\n\n\n\n\nYou can submit jobs with dependencies by using the \n-hold_jid\n option. For example, the command below submits a job that won't run until job 12345 has finished:\n\n\nqsub -hold_jid 12345 myscript.sh\n\n\n\n\nYou may specify node type with the \n-ac allow=\n flags as below: \n\n\nqsub -ac allow=XYZ myscript.sh\n\n\n\n\nThat would restrict the job to running on nodes of type X, Y or Z (the older Legion nodes).\n\n\nNote that for debugging purposes, it helps us if you have these options inside your jobscript rather than passed in on the command line whenever possible. We (and you) can see the exact jobscript that was submitted for every job that ran but not what command line options you submitted it with.\n\n\nChecking your previous jobscripts\n\n\nIf you want to check what you submitted for a specific job ID, you can do it with the \nscriptfor\n utility.\n\n\nscriptfor 12345\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned above, this will not show any command line options you passed in.\n\n\nHow do I monitor a job?\n\n\nqstat\n\n\nThe \nqstat\n command shows the status of your jobs. By default, if you run it with no options, it shows only your jobs (and no-one else\u2019s). This makes it easier to keep track of your jobs. \n\n\nThe output will look something like this:\n\n\njob-ID  prior   name       user         state submit/start at     queue                          slots ja-task-ID \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n123454 2.00685 DI_m3      ccxxxxx      Eqw   10/13/2017 15:29:11                                    12 \n123456 2.00685 DI_m3      ccxxxxx      r     10/13/2017 15:29:11 Yorick@node-x02e-006               24 \n123457 2.00398 DI_m2      ucappka      qw    10/12/2017 14:42:12                                    1 \n\n\n\n\nThis shows you the job ID, the numeric priority the scheduler has assigned to the job, the name you have given the job, your username, the state the job is in, the date and time it was submitted at (or started at, if it has begun), the head node of the job, the number of 'slots' it is taking up, and if it is an array job the last column shows the task ID.\n\n\nThe queue name (\nYorick\n here) is generally not useful. The head node name (\nnode-x02e-006\n) is useful - the \nnode-x\n part tells you this is an X-type node. \n\n\nIf you want to get more information on a particular job, note its job ID and then use the -f and -j flags to get full output about that job. Most of this information is not very useful.\n\n\nqstat -f -j 12345\n\n\n\n\nJob states\n\n\nqw\n: queueing, waiting\n \nr\n: running\n \nRq\n: a pre-job check on a node failed and this job was put back in the queue\n \nRr\n: this job was rescheduled but is now running on a new node\n \nEqw\n: there was an error in this jobscript. This will not run.\n \nt\n: this job is being transferred\n \ndr\n: this job is being deleted\n\n\nMany jobs cycling between \nRq\n and \nRr\n generally means there is a dodgy compute node which is failing pre-job checks, but is free so everything tries to run there. In this case, let us know and we will investigate. \n\n\nIf a job stays in \nt\n or \ndr\n state for a long time, the node it was on is likely to be unresponsive - again let us know and we'll investigate.\n\n\nA job in \nEqw\n will remain in that state until you delete it - you should first have a look at what the error was with \nqexplain\n.\n\n\nqexplain\n\n\nThis is a utility to show you the non-truncated error reported by your job. \nqstat -j\n will show you a truncated version near the bottom of the output.\n\n\nqexplain 123454\n\n\n\n\nqdel\n\n\nYou use \nqdel\n to delete a job from the queue.\n\n\nqdel 123454\n\n\n\n\nYou can delete all your jobs at once:\n\n\nqdel '*'\n\n\n\n\nMore scheduler commands\n\n\nHave a look at \nman qstat\n and note the commands shown in the \nSEE ALSO\n section of the manual page. Exit the manual page and then look at the \nman\n pages for those. (You will not be able to run all commands).\n\n\nnodesforjob\n\n\nThis is a utility that shows you the current \n\n\nHow do I run a graphical program?",

You can also pass options directly to the qsub command and this will override the settings in your script. This can be useful if you are scripting your job submissions in more complicated ways.  For example, if you want to change the name of the job for this one instance of the job you can submit your script with:  qsub -N NewName myscript.sh  Or if you want to increase the wall-clock time to 24 hours:  qsub -l h_rt=24:0:0 myscript.sh  You can submit jobs with dependencies by using the  -hold_jid  option. For example, the command below submits a job that won't run until job 12345 has finished:  qsub -hold_jid 12345 myscript.sh  You may specify node type with the  -ac allow=  flags as below:   qsub -ac allow=XYZ myscript.sh  That would restrict the job to running on nodes of type X, Y or Z (the older Legion nodes).  Note that for debugging purposes, it helps us if you have these options inside your jobscript rather than passed in on the command line whenever possible. We (and you) can see the exact jobscript that was submitted for every job that ran but not what command line options you submitted it with.",
