# Planned Outages

The second Tuesday of every month is a maintenance day, when the following clusters should be considered at risk from 8:00AM: Myriad, Kathleen, Thomas, Young, Michael, Aristotle and the Data Science Platform. We wonâ€™t necessarily perform maintenance every month, and notice by email will not always be given about maintenance day work that only puts services at risk.

Full details of outages are emailed to the cluster-specific user lists. 

Generally speaking, an outage will last from the morning of the first date listed until mid-morning of the end date listed. The nodes may need to be emptied of jobs in advance ('drained'), so jobs may remain in the queue for longer before an outage begins.

If there is a notable delay in bringing the system back we will contact you after approximately midday - please don't email us at 9am on the listed end days!

After an outage, the first day or two back should be considered 'at risk'; that is, things are more likely to go wrong without warning and we might need to make adjustments.

Date                | Service | Status | Reason 
--------------------|---------|--------|--------
14 Sept 2021        | Myriad  | Planned | Queues drained for 8am so that the central software installs can be redistributed over more servers. This is to help mitigate the effects of current filesystem issues.
