# Planned Outages

The second Tuesday of every month is a maintenance day, when the following clusters should be considered at risk from 8:00AM: Myriad, Kathleen, Thomas, Young, Michael, Aristotle and the Data Science Platform. We wonâ€™t necessarily perform maintenance every month, and notice by email will not always be given about maintenance day work that only puts services at risk.

Full details of outages are emailed to the cluster-specific user lists. 

Generally speaking, an outage will last from the morning of the first date listed until mid-morning of the end date listed. The nodes may need to be emptied of jobs in advance ('drained'), so jobs may remain in the queue for longer before an outage begins.

If there is a notable delay in bringing the system back we will contact you after approximately midday - please don't email us at 9am on the listed end days!

After an outage, the first day or two back should be considered 'at risk'; that is, things are more likely to go wrong without warning and we might need to make adjustments.

Date                | Service | Status | Reason 
--------------------|---------|--------|--------
18 -> 21 Apr 2023 | Myriad | Planned | Power work taking place in the datacentre that Myriad is in which may result in some cabinets losing power. We will be draining jobs for the morning of Tuesday 18 April and re-enabling them again once the work is complete. Since 21 April is a Friday, we may not be able to re-enable jobs until Monday.
