## Training

Due to the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, our ordinary training courses have been
suspended indefinitely.

We have an online Moodle course "Introduction to the Unix Shell" and
infrequently provide a training course aimed at getting users up and running on
one of our main clusters. Please see our
[Research IT Training page](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/research-it/research-it-training)
for details.
