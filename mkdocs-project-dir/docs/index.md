# Research Computing Services

This documentation is maintained by the research computing team for the purpose
of sharing information about our services, including user guides,
service updates and account request and renewal support.

## Documentation

General User Information:

 - [Getting an Account](Account_Services.md)
 - [Guide for New Users](New_Users.md)
 - [Guide for Experienced Users](Experienced_Users.md)

 - [Myriad](Systems/Myriad)
 - [Grace](Systems/Grace.md)
 - [Thomas](Systems/Thomas.md)
 - [Michael](Systems/Michael.md)

## Email Support

For support for any of our services, contact us at: [rc-support@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:rc-support@ucl.ac.uk)

We will endeavour to answer queries on any aspect of computing related to your research whatever your skill level or requirements.

## How to...

 - [Connect to the Research Data Storage service](Connecting_to_Research_Data_Services.md)
 - [Report a problem with one of our computing platforms](Reporting_problems.md)
 - [Access services from outside UCL](Accessing_RC_Systems.md#Accessing_services_from_outside_UCL)
 - [Apply for access to national GPU clusters](GPU_Clusters.md)
 - [Get more resources](Additional_Resource_Requests.md) (more storage, more compute time, longer run time, etc)

## Training

We infrequently provide a training course aimed at getting users up and running on one of our main clusters. Please see our [Training page](Training.md) for details.
