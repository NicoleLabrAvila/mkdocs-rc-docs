UCL users may be able to access the following GPU clusters.

## National GPU clusters

There are two nationally-accessible EPSRC Tier 2 HPC centres with GPUs.

Access is generally managed through calls to an EPSRC Resource
Allocation Panel

  - [Autumn 2017 Tier 2 RAP call](https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/funding/calls/tier2openaccess/)
  - [Spring 2018 Tier 2 RAP call](https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/funding/calls/resourceallocationpanel-rap-openaccesstotier2-spring2018/)
  - [Autumn 2018 Tier 2 RAP call](https://epsrc.ukri.org/funding/calls/rapopenaccesstier2autumn2018/):
    technical assessment deadline 25 Sept at 16:00, closes 9 Oct at
    16:00.

There may also be pump-priming/proof of concept access available.

General information about machines with external access is available at
