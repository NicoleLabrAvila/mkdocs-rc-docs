# Getting an Account 

We have a single simplified application process for access to our internal UCL clusters: Legion,
Myriad, and Grace. These are available to all UCL researcher staff, and available to research 
students upon sponsorship by an appropriate member of UCL staff. (See application process below.) 

Use of these services is subject to a common set of [terms and conditions](Terms_and_Conditions.md). 

The online application form can be found here:

  - [User account application form](https://signup.rc.ucl.ac.uk/computing/requests/new) (UCL login
    required via Shibboleth)

We also run clusters that serve particular user groups including users
from outside UCL. For information about applying for accounts on those
resources, please see their information pages:

 - [Molecular Modelling and Materials Hub -- Thomas](Thomas.md)
 - [Molecular Modelling and Materials Hub -- Michael](Michael.md)

## Account sponsors

If you are a student or postdoctoral researcher, your application must be
approved by a permanent member of staff (normally your supervisor or PI). You
will need to enter the UCL username (e.g. ccaaxyz, not the UPI) of this sponsor
in the application form, and an email will be sent to this person asking them
to approve the application before the account can be created.

Permanent members of staff do not need a sponsor and their accounts will
be automatically approved.

!!! note
    You and your sponsor will need a central UCL username and password. 
    For most people, this is the account they use to access their UCL email.

## Application process

The application process then runs as follows:

1.  Enter your UCL userid and password to access the application form.
2.  Complete the application form, reading the instructions carefully.
    *Tip:* Hover your mouse over text boxes for more information.
3.  Upon completion, your nominated sponsor will receive an email asking
    for the application to be approved. (If they do not receive this,
    contact rc-support@ucl.ac.uk). If you do not require a sponsor, your
    account will be automatically approved.
4.  Your sponsor should click on the link in the email and approve the
    account.
5.  You will receive an email when your account is approved if you have
    a sponsor.
6.  You should receive an email once we have created your account.
    Please note that there may be a delay of up to one working day
    between an application being approved and it being created.

If your sponsor does not receive the email, you can send them the link
to your application directly (which will look like <https://signup.rc.ucl.ac.uk/computing/requests/0000>).

## Accounts for visitors

Applications for UCL visitors to use Research Computing services are
welcomed. Please note that:

1.  Applicants must have a central UCL account. Queries about how to
    obtain a UCL account for visitors should be addressed, in the first
    instance, to your Departmental Administrator.
2.  Account applications should specify the UCL grant under which the
    work is being carried out, if possible, as well as an associated UCL
    group or researcher.
3.  Account applications may not be submitted on behalf of another
    except to cover accessibility requirements, as the account
    application process includes agreeing to relevant legal terms and
    conditions.

## Accounts for honorary staff

UCL Staff Members may sponsor Honorary members (named individuals) to
be provided with access to Research Computing services where this is
beneficial to UCL’s research interests.

This application process is identical to the process above for students and
non-permanent staff.

All accounts thus provided are subject to all other ‘standard’ terms and conditions
relating to their use of Research Computing services.

## Charges for use of research computing services

No direct charges are currently applicable for non-exceptional use of
any Research Computing services in accordance with standard resource
allocation policy as defined by the
[Computational Resource Allocation Group](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/about/governance/research-it/crag) (CRAG).

Several methods are available to researchers who wish to gain access to
additional resources, or obtain 'priority' use, including chargeable
options. Details are available [here](Additional_Resource_Requests.md).
