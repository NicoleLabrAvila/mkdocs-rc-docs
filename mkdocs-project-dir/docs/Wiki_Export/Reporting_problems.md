RC Systems' support process is based around a ticketing system. To
submit a ticket please send an e-mail to <rc-support@ucl.ac.uk>.

In order to help our support team deal with your ticket efficiently,
please ensure the following is the case:

1.  You have a clear description of your problem. This should include:
      - Which system you are using (Myriad, Legion, Grace, Aristotle etc).
      - Your userid.
      - What you were doing when you got the error.
      - What the error was (including a copy of the exact error message
        on the email body or a relevant extract).
      - Job IDs, job scripts and job output/error files if relevant.
2.  Please avoid creating duplicate tickets. If you are following up on
    an existing problem, please reply to a response from the ticketing
    system (or at least a message with the ticket ID in the subject) for
    the original ticket. This way our support staff will be able to see
    a complete history of your problem, and it is considerably more
    likely that your issue will be dealt with by a member of staff who
    is familiar with the history of your problem.
