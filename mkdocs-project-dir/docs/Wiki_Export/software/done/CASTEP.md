# CASTEP

CASTEP is a full-featured materials modelling code based on a
first-principles quantum mechanical description of electrons and nuclei.
Using density functional theory, it can simulate a wide range of
properties of materials proprieties including energetics, structure at
the atomic level, vibrational properties, electronic response properties
etc. In particular it has a wide range of spectroscopic features that
link directly to experiment, such as infra-red and Raman spectroscopies,
NMR, and core level spectra. CASTEP is developed by members of the
CASTEP Developers Group (CDG) who are currently all UK based academics.

Access to CASTEP is enabled by a module file and being a member of the
appropriate reserved application group. Please email rc-support AT
ucl.ac.uk to get your userid added to the CASTEP group.

On Legion CASTEP is intended to be run primarily within batch jobs
however you may run short (less than 5 minutes execution time)
interactive tests on the Login Nodes and longer interactive tests on the
User Test Nodes.

To use CASTEP you need to load the module:

```
module load castep/17.21/intel-2017
```
