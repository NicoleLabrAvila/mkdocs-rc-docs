==License==

Before you can run GATK, you need to sign up for a gatkforums account at https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/download/ and then agree to the license at https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/download/auth?package=GATK. Tell us you have done so, and we can add you to the GATK group so you can access the software.

==Running GATK==

GATK is currently not compatible with Java 1.8, so you need to use the system Java 1.7. Set up your modules as follows:

<code>
 module load gatk/3.4.46
</code>

Then to run GATK, you should either prefix the .jar you want to run with <code>$GATKPATH</code>:

<code>
 java -Xmx2g -jar $GATKPATH/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar OPTION1=value1 OPTION2=value2...
</code>

Or we provide wrappers, so you can run it one of these ways instead:

<code>
 GenomeAnalysisTK OPTION1=value1 OPTION2=value2...
 gatk OPTION1=value1 OPTION2=value2...
</code>
