|about=
Provides the Parrot connector to CVMFS, the CernVM File System. 

The CernVM File System provides a scalable, reliable and low-maintenance software distribution service. It was developed to assist High Energy Physics (HEP) collaborations to deploy software on the worldwide-distributed computing infrastructure used to run data processing applications.

|version=5.4.1
|link1 = [https://cernvm.cern.ch CernVM website]
|link2 = [https://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem/parrot Parrot Connector for CernVM]
|moduleload1=cctools/5.4.1/gnu-4.9.2
|setup-notes=
By default, the module sets the following:
<code>
 export PARROT_CVMFS_REPO=<default-repositories> 
 export PARROT_ALLOW_SWITCHING_CVMFS_REPOSITORIES=yes 
 export HTTP_PROXY=DIRECT;
</code>

Example usage - will list the contents of the repository then exit:

<code>
 module load cctools/5.4.1/gnu-4.9.2
 parrot-run bash
 ls /cvmfs/alice.cern.ch
 exit
</code>

That will create the cache in <code>/tmp/parrot.xxxxx</code> on the login nodes when run interactively. To use in a job, you will want to put it somewhere in your space that the compute nodes can access. You can set the cache to be in your Scratch, or to $TMPDIR on the nodes if it just needs to exist for the duration of that job.

<code>
 export PARROT_CVMFS_ALIEN_CACHE=</path/to/cache>
</code>
