# Account Services

Information about how to apply for an account to use available Research
Computing services is provided below.

## Internal UCL Clusters

We have a single simplified application process for access to the Legion, Myriad, and Grace clusters. Use of these services is subject to a common
set of [terms and conditions](https://wiki.rc.ucl.ac.uk/wiki/Terms_and_Conditions). All
applications currently cover a Legion and Myriad account while access to other systems depends on the resources you apply for.

We also run clusters that serve particular user groups including users from outside UCL. For information about apply for accounts on those resources, please see their information pages:

 - [Molecular Modelling and Materials Hub -- Thomas](Thomas.md)
 - [Molecular Modelling and Materials Hub -- Michael](Michael)

### Account sponsors

If you are a student or postdoctoral researcher, your application must
be approved by a permanent member of staff (normally your supervisor or
PI). You will need to enter the UCL username (e.g. ccaaxyz, not the UPI)
of this sponsor in the application form, and an email will be sent to
this person asking them to approve the application before the account
can be created.

Permanent members of staff do not need a sponsor and their accounts will
be automatically approved.

  - You will need a UCL userid and password.

### Apply for an account

The online application form can be found here:

  - [User account application form](https://signup.rc.ucl.ac.uk/computing/requests/new) (UCL login
    required via Shibboleth)

### Application process

The application process then runs as follows:

1.  Enter your UCL userid and password to access the application form.
2.  Complete the application form, reading the instructions carefully.
    *Tip:* Hover your mouse over text boxes for more information.
3.  Upon completion, your nominated sponsor will receive an email asking
    for the application to be approved. (If they do not receive this,
    contact rc-support@ucl.ac.uk). If you do not require a sponsor, your
    account will be automatically approved.
4.  Your sponsor should click on the link in the email and approve the
    account.
5.  You will receive an email when your account is approved if you have
    a sponsor.
6.  You should receive an email once we have created your account.
    Please note that there may be a delay of up to one working day
    between an application being approved and it being created.

If your sponsor does not receive the email, you can send them the link
to your application directly (will look like <https://signup.rc.ucl.ac.uk/computing/requests/0000>).

## Accounts for visitors

Applications for UCL visitors to use Research Computing services are
welcomed. Please note that:

1.  Applicants must have a central UCL account. Queries about how to
    obtain a UCL account for visitors should be addressed, in the first
    instance, to your Departmental Administrator.
2.  Account applications should specify the UCL grant under which the
    work is being carried out, if possible, as well as an associated UCL
    group or researcher.
3.  Account applications may not be submitted on behalf of another
    except to cover accessibility requirements, as the account
    application process includes agreeing to relevant legal terms and
    conditions.

## Accounts for honorary staff

UCL Staff Members may sponsor Honorary members (named individuals) to
be provided with access to Research Computing services where this is
beneficial to UCL’s research interests.

This application process is identical to the process above for students and non-permanent staff.

All accounts thus provided are subject to all other ‘standard’ T\&C’s
relating to their use of Research Computing services.

## Charges for use of research computing services

No direct charges are currently applicable for non-exceptional use of
any Research Computing services in accordance with standard resource
allocation policy as defined by the
[CRAG](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/about/governance/research-it/crag).

Several methods are available to researchers who wish to gain access to
additional resources, or obtain 'priority' use, including chargeable
options. Details are available [here](Legion_Priority_Access).
