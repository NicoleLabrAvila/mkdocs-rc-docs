## Drop-In Sessions

Research IT Services holds drop-in sessions roughly every two weeks which at least one member of the Research Computing team usually attends. More details and dates for these sessions are available on the [the RITS pages](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/research-it/research-it-data-management-drop-ins).

If you have a particularly complex problem, it may be useful to email the support address, <rc-support@ucl.ac.uk>, beforehand so that the person attending can prepare.

Please note that this is a busy, mixed-group office, and people attempting to gain support by walking in uninvited may not be made welcome.
