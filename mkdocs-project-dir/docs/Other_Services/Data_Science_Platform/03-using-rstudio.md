## Packages
Users can install R packages in their home directories, but we recommend that if you are planning on teaching a course, you make sure the packages you want to use are pre-installed on the system. This saves time and reduces the load on the server.

### What packages are currently installed?
The main version of R used by the rstudio server copies it's packages from the Myriad high performance computing platform, so any package available there should be available in rstudio too. There's an automatically updated list here: [R packages](/Installed_Software_Lists/r-packages).

Alternatively, check the list of available packages from the RStudio IDE.

Please also remember to test that the packages you want to use are working as expected.
