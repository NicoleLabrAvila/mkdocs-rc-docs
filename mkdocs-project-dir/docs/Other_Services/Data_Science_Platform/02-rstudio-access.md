The terms of the software licence for RStudio Server Pro restrict usage to teaching and the platform should not be used for any personal, research or commercial activity. To access the service users must first submit a request.

## Requesting access for yourself
If you would like to use the RStudio server for teaching, please contact [rits@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:rits@ucl.ac.uk) with the following information:

* Your name
* Your username
* Your email address

You will receive email confirmation once you have been given access. Please feel free to try out the service and test teaching materials, but note the restrictions on use for other purposes outlined above. Access will last for one year after which time you will need to reapply to use the service.

## Requesting access for students
### SITS modules
If you are intending to teach a course registered in SITS, please contact [rits@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:rits@ucl.ac.uk) with the following information:

* The module ID of the course you intend to teach; e.g. STAT0001
* A link or pdf of the course syllabus
* The start and end dates of the course

You will receive email confirmation once this has been set up. The module ID will be used to grant access to students registered on that module in SITS. If you experience any problems with students getting access, please check they are registered in SITS before contacting [rits@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:rits@ucl.ac.uk) for assistance.

### Non-SITS courses
For other training courses not registered in SITS, please contact [rits@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:rits@ucl.ac.uk) to pre-register the course and email a list of usernames in csv format at least one working day before the course starts.

## How to access
Once you have been given access, visit [rstudio.data-science.rc.ucl.ac.uk](https://rstudio.data-science.rc.ucl.ac.uk) and sign in with your UCL username and password.

Please note, the Data Science Platform and all of its components are only accessible from the UCL network. When off campus, you will need to [connect to the UCL VPN](https://ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/get-connected/ucl-virtual-private-network-vpn) first.

## Troubleshooting

The connection times out or the site cannot be reached

* Check that you are connected to the UCL VPN

Error: Incorrect or invalid username or password

* You might not have permission to access the service
* Either request access if you are a member of staff, or
* if you are a student ask your tutor to check if you have been given access
