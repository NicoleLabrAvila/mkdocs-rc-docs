|setup-notes=
MRtrix has a .mrtrix.conf that is copied to your home directory the first time you run this module from a login node. It sets:

   Analyse.LeftToRight: false
   NumberOfThreads: 4

Alter <code>NumberOfThreads</code> to what you are using in your job script.

=GUI tools unavailable=

<code>mrview</code> and <code>shview</code> in MRtrix 3 cannot be run over a remote X11 connection so are not usable on Legion. To use these tools you will need a local install on your own computer.
