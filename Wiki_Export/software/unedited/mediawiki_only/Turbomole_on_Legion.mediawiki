=Running Turbomole=

There are scripts you can use to generate Turbomole jobs for you: 
<code>
 /shared/ucl/apps/turbomole/turbomole-mpi.submit
 /shared/ucl/apps/turbomole/turbomole-smp.submit
</code>

They will ask you which version you want to use, how much memory, how many cores etc and set up and submit the job for you.

Use the first for MPI jobs and the second for single-node shared memory threaded jobs.
