MISO (Mixture of Isoforms) is a probabilistic framework that quantitates the expression level of alternatively spliced genes from RNA-Seq data, and identifies differentially regulated isoforms or exons across samples.
|about=
MISO (Mixture of Isoforms) is a probabilistic framework that quantitates the expression level of alternatively spliced genes from RNA-Seq data, and identifies differentially regulated isoforms or exons across samples. By modeling the generative process by which reads are produced from isoforms in RNA-Seq, the MISO model uses Bayesian inference to compute the probability that a read originated from a particular isoform.

=Submitting jobs from within MISO=

MISO has an option to create and submit parallel jobs itself. If using this, you can copy miso_settings.txt as shown below and add the correct qsub options to the qsub command.

If letting MISO call qsub, don't do this inside a qsubbed jobscript - jobs running on the compute nodes cannot create new jobs. Instead invoke MISO from a terminal and it will submit the parallel jobs itself.
