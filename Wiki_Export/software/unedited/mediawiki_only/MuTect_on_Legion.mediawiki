|name=MuTect
|platform=Legion
|version=1.1.7
|short=MuTect is a GATK-based variant caller specialized for somatic/cancer variants.
|about=MuTect is a tool developed at the Broad Institute for the reliable and accurate identification of somatic point mutations in next generation sequencing data of cancer genomes. It is built on top of the GenomeAnalysisToolkit (GATK), which is also developed at the Broad Institute, so it uses the same command-line conventions and (almost all) the same input and output file formats.

MuTect operates on sequencing data for matched normal and tumor tissue samples, and it outputs mutation calls as well as optional coverage results.

==License==

Before you can run MuTect, you need to sign up for a gatkforums account at https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/download/ and then agree to the license at https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/download/auth?package=MuTect. Tell us you have done so, and we can add you to the MuTect group so you can access the software.

==Running MuTect==

MuTect is currently not compatible with Java 1.8, so you need to use the system Java 1.7. Set up your modules as follows:

<code>
 module load mutect/1.1.7
</code>

Then to run MuTect, you should either prefix the .jar you want to run with <code>$MUTECTPATH</code>:

<code>
 java -Xmx2g -jar $MUTECTPATH/mutect-1.1.7.jar OPTION1=value1 OPTION2=value2...
</code>

Or we provide wrappers, so you can run it this way instead:

<code>
 mutect OPTION1=value1 OPTION2=value2...
</code>
